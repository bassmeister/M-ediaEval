55;Apollo Beyond (Ch. 21 of 21): The Final Solution;"<p><span>Is there something special about the year 2012? What does it hold for us? Have there really been signs along the road that we&#39;re headed toward something big? Or do we simply see what we want to see? Coincidences?<br /></span></p><p><span><br />No matter which culture or Age, for thousands of years the common thread has been man&#39;s seemingly irresistible compulsion to tell stories to explain his reality, his world, his universe. We, as humans, love to tell stories. The stories have changed over the millenia, but the stories are still there nonetheless. Once we told stories of gods that rode across the sky to light up the day. Now, we tell stories of alien forces controlling our governments and abducting our people. Does it make any difference if it&#39;s true or not so long as someone is willing to kill over such beliefs?<br /></span></p><p><span><br />Da Vinci Code, Foucault&#39;s Pendulum. So many seemingly connected events, so much faith ultimately required. Are there truly conspiracies at work or just really observant, obsessive nut-jobs seeing things that aren&#39;t really there. Such people who don&#39;t have the sanity to apply Occam&#39;s Razor in their pursuit of the truth are dangerous. As long as it fits in with their belief system, they&#39;d believe there was a conspiracy in a bowl of cornflakes if they were told it was so.<br /></span></p><p><span><br />Whether it&#39;s 9/11, anthropogenic global warming, animal rights, gun control, or even a bowl of cornflakes, one should always take an overly healthy dose of skepticism with every bite of garbage that is thrown at them (from either side)--then chase it down with a little Occam&#39;s Razor and a splash of reality....just because things look connected doesn&#39;t always mean that they are.<br /></span></p><p><span><br />""It is still a beautiful world.

102;Querencia Cancion interpretada por los Hnos Quezada;"<p>En la primavera del 2008 todos los hermanos Quezada Escandon, familiares y amigos se reunieron en la mansion de Hernan y Rosario Quezada. Cuando digo: todos es porque muy rara vez Ud podra ver a Fernando, Cynthia, Hernan, Eduardo, Lynda, Conrado y Antonio juntos. En la tertulia se realizaron amenas actividades en un ambiente de fiesta y algarabia en donde se sirvieron sabrosos antojitos Mexicanos. Al caer la noche hubo una improvisada hora bohemia en la que a Eduardo Quezada se le ocurrio sentarse a tocar piano y Tony Quezada se le unio para cantar una cancion del cantautor Luis Eduardo Aute. Y este fue el resultado. </p><p>LETRA DE CANCION - QUERENCIA (ALEVOSIA) </p><p>Que duro quererte asi <br />contigo pero sin ti <br />amando tu cuerpo <br />pero tu a anos luz de mi.<br /> No quiero saber porque <br />para que arriesgarme <br />a que me respondas: ""no lo se""... <br />Prefiero sospecharle en otros brazos <br />y partirme en mil pedazos <br />a seguir muerto de pie. <br />Como romper con tu indiferencia, <br />como vencer esta mala <br />querencia por ti <br />carencia de ti... querencia por ti... <br /><br />Te miro pero no estas <br />ni veo un punal detras, <br />dispuesto a asestarme el golpe <br />de un ""nunca jamas"" <br />Tu tibio dejarte hacer <br />no es mas que una forma lenta <br />de desaparecer... <br />una manera de emprender la huida <br />a traves de este suicida <br />simulacro de placer. <br /><br />Si te adivinara un ""no"", <br />seria que algo paso <br />cualquier tonteria, <br />incluso un crimen, que se yo... <br />Y asi seria capaz de poner fin <br />a la guerra infinita de esta paz... <br />Que duro ver el rostro <br />de la muerte cada vez <br />que intento verte mas alla<br /> de tu antifaz.</p>";False;355;http://blip.tv/file/863570;1;11991;http://blip.tv/file/get/Eduardoquezada-QuerenciaCancionInterpretadaPorLosHnosQuezada599.flv;24060529;215

179;"David Sirota: ""Country First""";"<div><strong>Country First</strong></div><div> </div><div>Let&#39;s say that you enjoyed watching last week&#39;s Republican National Convention on television.</div><div> </div><div>Let&#39;s say you drank in the almost uniformly white faces and the regimented revivalism, you clapped when speakers belittled Barack Obama&#39;s work organizing impoverished communities, indeed, you cheered with Rudy Giuliani&#39;s zinger, ""Drill, baby, drill!""</div><div> </div><div>Let&#39;s further stipulate that you were not at all discomfited by the convention&#39;s incessant ""Country First"" mantra that defines loyalty to America as lockstep fealty to the Republican Party.</div><div> </div><div>Let&#39;s say -- for sheer argument&#39;s sake, of course -- all of this is true. What, then, of the substance? Stripping away the partisanship, passion and propaganda, what about the veracity of the claim that the GOP puts this country first?</div><div> </div><div>Well, let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a little dicey.</div><div> </div><div>On national security, the Republican Party advocates continuing to force thousands of young Americans to risk life and limb refereeing Iraq&#39;s civil war. Though the party&#39;s slogan hearkens back to conservatives&#39; ""America First"" isolationism, the GOP nonetheless supports spending $12 billion a month on the war -- money needed at home. </div><div> </div><div>Same story on economics. In 2004, the Republican White House called outsourcing ""a plus."" In 2006, the Republican commander-in-chief okayed the sale of critical infrastructure to foreign dictators. And today the Republican presidential nominee is demanding more NAFTA-style trade pacts that eliminate American jobs. This, says the GOP, is putting our country first.</div><div> </div><div>But who is the ""country""? According to the Census Bureau, it will soon be mostly non-whites. That is, the demographic groups who the alleged ""country first"" party regularly disparages, whether Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) yearning for a return to segregation, Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) scapegoating Latinos, Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.) celebrating Japanese internment, President Bush genuflecting to Bob Jones University&#39;s white supremacists, or Ronald Reagan echoing bigoted rallying cries at the scene of Mississippi race murders.</div><div> </div><div>Maybe, you insist in your post-convention fervor, I just don&#39;t get it. Maybe ""country first"" really does mean refereeing foreign civil wars, spending billions overseas while cutting domestic programs, exporting jobs and bashing ethnic groups that will soon comprise the majority of the nation.</div><div> </div><div>But I don&#39;t think so. More likely, Republicans have simply taken the famous parable to heart -- the one about patriotism being the last refuge of scoundrels.</div><div> </div><div>As a political strategy, it&#39;s not stupid. Following the Bush-DeLay-Abramoff era, many Americans rightly think Republican politicians are scoundrels. And so those politicians are trying to make sure ""this election is not about issues,"" as John McCain&#39;s campaign manager said this week, but about a hideous hypernationalism only Joe McCarthy could love. Employing flag pins, war stories and Bible-thumping social conservatism, former P.O.W. McCain and Christian fundamentalist Sarah Palin hope their red-white-and-blue phantasmagoria will hypnotize America into voting Republican.</div><div> </div><div>Such desperation leads to seeming incoherence at times. For instance, when anti-war protestors at the GOP convention demanded lawmakers actually put country first by bringing the troops home, Republican delegates responded like an entranced mob of cultists, mindlessly chanting ""U.S.A.""</div><div> </div><div>Then again, in the Karl Rove age, every televised scene -- no matter how absurd -- is part of sculpting an election victory with a mallet of jingoism and a chisel of intolerance.</div><div> </div><div>On the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 atrocities, the Republican convention reminds us of what Barry Goldwater suggested 44 years ago: Terrorists are not the only ones who believe extremism is &#8220;no vice.&#8221; And, as the old aphorism warns, when the most virulent extremism attacks our country, it won&#39;t be shrouded in Islamic fatwas - it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross. </div><div> </div><div>Sadly, the when is now. McCain is the flag, Palin is the cross -- and Americans will have to decide whether we believe their zealotry puts country first.</div>";False;154;http://blip.tv/file/1257075;1;199335;http://blip.tv/file/get/Lauraflanders-DavidSirotaCountryFirst158.flv;9692435;360

Toklas Democratic Club -- and founder of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, fighting ageism and homophobia together. Together, Martin and Lyons wrote ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lesbian-Woman-Del-Martin/dp/091207891X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220027008&sr=1-1"">Lesbian/Woman</a>."" Martin is credited for coining the term ""battered woman"" with her book ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Battered-Wives-Del-Martin/dp/0912078707"">Battered Wives</a>""</p><p>Del Martin and her partner Phyllis Lyon became the first couple to legally marry in the United States on February 12, 2004 in San Francisco, California - after they had been together for more than 50 years. After that marriage was thrown out, they married again this June, when California became the second state to legally recognize same-sex marriage. She and Phyllis were two of the plaintiffs in the cases that won that marriage equality. </p><p>Del Martin died August 27, 2008 with her wife Phyllis Lyon at her side. She was 87 years old.

192;GRITtv Commentary: Monique Harden 9/3/08;As we approach the 3rd anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on August 29th and the sixth anniversary of 9/11, I wonder if people realize that when it comes to a national disaster no person in this country has the right to recover. Under the Robert T. Stafford Act, no person affected by a national disaster has the right to seek any form of assistance from the government even for medical emergencies. The Stafford Act also bestows on the president complete discretion in matters involving a national disaster. With a law that removes governmental accountability to the people, is it any wonder how the Bush Environmental Protection Agency was able to get off the hook for misinforming New Yorkers about air quality in the aftermath of 9/11?;False;97;http://blip.tv/file/1232200;1;199335;http://blip.tv/file/get/Lauraflanders-GRITtvCommentaryMoniqueHarden9308247.flv;6267996;373

200;The F Word: August 11, 2008;What motivates the true revolutionary said Che Guevara were feelings of great love.

215;The F Word: Monsters R Us July 24, 2008;"A tall, well-built man with huge eyes and a rugged jaw. Radovan Karadzic rose from a tiny Montenegrin village to Sarajevo University, fame as a poet and, finally, to President of the Republika Srpska -- and infamy as one of the world&apos;s most wanted war criminals. An intellectual, Karadzic was known to recite verses, accompanying himself on a guitar. But his real instrument was the manipulation. He played Serbian insecurity like a lute. Inhaling popular doubt and anxiety -- about power, money, race and the future... and exhaling racism, nationalism, pride, a sense of wronged entitlement... Villagers became killers, neighbor against neighbor as if they were drunk on fear and lust for power. And the world watched. A deadly combo. The world watched again, when Karadzic was arrested Monday and there were those who asked; How is it that an intellectual and a poet could do such things? We like to think that people like this--the educated ones, the sophisticated ones, the poets for heaven sake --should know better. Don&apos;t they have higher moral standards that ordinary people? Maybe Karadzic wasn&apos;t really a poet. Or a super bad one. Or maybe the question&apos;s wrong. We wish that war criminals like Karadzic, were ""monsters."" Because that would be a comforting thought. Then they would be different, genetically, biologically, physically different . And the rest of us could relax. But those who commit genocide aren&apos;t born, they make choices. And they don&apos;t alone. And monsters are made of regular men and women like us. It takes a village.

225;The F Word: Why Obama Needs a New Deal, August 4, 2008;"<p>Sure it&#39;s important to <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080818/open_letter"">keep Obama in line</a> -- but before progressives stamp their feet too loudly, it&#8217;s worth taking a look at what a president Obama would inherit on day one: an economy on the edge. The U.S. deficit is now approaching <a href=""http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMSVWqL3tikhx7L_ompt0hDXO-5AD92792JG1"">half a trillion dollars for 2009</a>. Think about what it would mean to pay the interest on that amount of money. The veterans administration is spending more than <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-07-22-vabudget_N.htm"">$80 billion</a> a year to help injured vets and the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/business/04lend.html?ref=business"">second&#8211;biggest wave of mortgage defaults</a> is about to hit shore. Delinquencies among prime loans &#8211; the lion&#8217;s share of the market - have doubled and let&#8217;s not forget that <a href=""http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1802631/"">General Motors is teetering on bankruptcy</a> and Ford is not far behind. </p><p>In Europe, word is that had the U.S. government not stepped in to shore up mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Chinese government would have taken dramatic action to move away from U.S.-backed securities. That&#39;s because China held so much of the debt Fannie and Freddie sell. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/books/review/Gross-t.html?_r=1&ref=books&oref=slogin"">Kevin Phillips</a>, a keen observer of the American political economy --- warned in his last book that U.S. data understate inflation, in other words, the price of food and fuel is going up even faster than we know. And, he argues, unemployment is significantly higher than the government tells us. </p><p>There&#8217;s not much good news anywhere on the U.S. economic front. So what does that mean for Obama? Simply that bold and sweeping change is not just smart election strategy&#8211;it may be the only thing that stands a chance of keeping the U.S. economy on this side of the cliffside.</p>";False;126;http://blip.tv/file/1145829;1;199335;http://blip.tv/file/get/Lauraflanders-TheFWordWhyObamaNeedsANewDealAugust42008168.flv;8058306;406

250;Armor of God;"It is possible to live the call in the United States. When we are enlisted and receive our uniform, the whole armor of God, we are outfitted like Jesus&#8212;the divine warrior whose weapons destroyed strongholds by saving, healing, teaching, delivering those captive to demons, loving enemies and even suffering. <br /><br /> Sisters and brothers, we stand as one body in a Superpower nation. We are an army of love, with truth telling as our belt, justice across our chest, wearing sandals of peace, headgear of salvation and packing the Word. This is an unmistakable uniform. We are at Christ&#8217;s command. <br /><strong><br /> Independence Day: </strong>The United States of America needs Mennonite Church USA to live the call. In the whole Christian family we are just one among siblings, but there is wisdom in this church. We have no need to protect the positions or privileges we have. God does not call us to preserve our wealth or our status but to give our lives for others. Soldiering is a sacrificial vocation. The Lord&#8217;s battle plan does not include self-preservation.

258;"Noah Gundersen ""Jesus Jesus"" Live @ The Red Room 3.15.2009";"<p><span><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/noahgundersen"">www.myspace.com/noahgundersen</a></span> </p><p>Noah Gundersen writes to the soul. His lyrics touch on all levels of the human condition: the sorrow, the joy, the love, the fear, and the longing. The spirit of the middle class American. Coupled with dynamic musicianship, the music makes for a vibrant and engaging experience, both live and on disc. Drawing from the influence of Ryan Adams, Wilco, and Counting Crows, this young artist is creating music in a brand new world. <br /><br />The first thing you&#39;ll notice about Noah is that he&#39;s a young man. When you hear him sing, you&#39;ll wonder how old his heart is. Combining deeply personal lyrics, acoustic folk-rock guitar work, and a passionate voice, Noah creates emotive songs for his listeners. He expresses personal thoughts in hope that ""someone will hear a song and be touched somewhere in their heart that often goes by unnoticed."" <br />- The Sisters Folk Festival <br /><br />""Brand New World"" gives us a steady, surging feel, a swelling of distended guitars and atmospheric violin. Noah&#39;s vocals-soaring melodies, death-defying emotional acrobatics and pipes that could wail the phonebook and make it sound like a suicide note, make a messy, multidimensional celebration of life. <br />- Patrick Adickes, The Emerald Scene <br /><br />Gundersen&#39;s voice is a multifaceted, subtle thing that imbues his quiet folk with a sense of urgency and importance that acoustic strumming alone could never convey. If you&#39;re even a passing fan of Sufjan Stevens, Josh Ritter or Conor Oberst, Gundersen&#39;s your man. <br />- Jeff Echert, The Pacific Northwest Inlander <br /><br />Go see this dude play a show. Gundersen&#39;s voice is powerful and versatile, yet raw; there are shades of Damien Rice and Adam Duritz -- clear influences reflected in his songs. He has a talent for writing melodies, and has a refreshing presence, void of pretension, contrived emotion, or arrogance. I read a review somewhere that categorized Noah&#39;s music as Christian Rock. That&#39;s bunk. Gundersen&#39;s music had an honesty that can&#39;t be found anywhere in that genre. Can&#39;t wait to hear where he is headed next. <br />- Pete, a fan <br /><br />I don&#8217;t know of any other young northwest artist with the ambition to release a live album. Recording a concert is challenging because what you play is exactly what&#8217;s captured, mistakes included. But this album is engaging because it&#8217;s raw and gutsy. <br />- Tommy, Garage Voice </p>";False;224;http://blip.tv/file/1906133;11;322857;http://blip.tv/file/get/Menomenation-NoahGundersenJesusJesusLiveTheRedRoom3152009756.flv;10332380;245

371;After the Economic Meltdown;"<span><p>The global meltdown has brought home the interconnectedness of the world&#39;s finance and trading systems. Failing financial institutions, frozen credit, volatile stock markets, mounting job losses, and painful cuts in wages are impacting the lives of struggling citizens worldwide.</p><p>Combined with growing skepticism about globalization, President-elect Barack Obama faces a challenging backdrop to the formulation of his international economic policy. The incoming administration will need to determine the level and objectives of development assistance, trade priorities, an approach to reform of international financial institutions, and a strategy to advance the Decent Work Agenda. Ideally these must be knitted together into an integrated economic policy. The new administration must also work together with progressive partners at home and abroad to address these daunting challenges, drive economic recovery, and strengthen the world economy&#39;s virtuous circle of mutually reinforcing gains in living standards.</p><p>Discussing these issues, UNDP Secretary General Kemal Dervis and ILO Director-General Juan Somavia will join CAP&#39;s Senior Fellow and World Economic Forum Managing Director, Richard Samans.</p><p><em>CAP is grateful to the Heinrich Böll Foundation for their support of this event.</em></p></span>";False;4945;http://blip.tv/file/1609086;3;41099;http://blip.tv/file/get/SEEPROGRESS-AfterTheEconomicMeltdown947.flv;10027401;439

Millions more are struggling to pay premiums that are growing five times faster than wages, but still seeing their benefits shrink. While some Americans have access to the most sophisticated medical care in the world, others are left to overcrowded emergency rooms, under-funded clinics, or no health care at all - all because they lack the insurance it takes to provide for the care they need. This is wrong. It violates America&#39;s deep, long-standing commitment to fairness for all of our citizens - old and young, weak and strong. Unlocking our health care system&#39;s potential for everyone in America is the great moral challenge of our time.

378;The Tyranny of Dead Ideas - Matt Miller HIGHLIGHTS;"<p><strong>http://www.mattmilleronline.com/</strong></p><p>What&#39;s the greatest threat to our economic future? The things we think we know&#8212;but don&#39;t... America is at a crossroads. In the face of global competition and rapid technological change, our economy is about to face its most severe test in nearly a century&#8212;one that will make the recent turmoil in the financial system look like a modest setback by comparison. Yet our leaders have failed to prepare us for what lies ahead because they are in the grip of a set of ""dead ideas"" about how a modern economy should work. They wrongly believe that * Our kids will earn more than we do * Free trade is always good, no matter who gets hurt * Employers should be responsible for health coverage * Taxes hurt the economy * Schools are a local matter * Money follows merit These ways of thinking&#8212;dubious at best and often dead wrong&#8212;are on a collision course with economic developments that are irreversible. In The Tyranny of Dead Ideas, Matt Miller offers a unique blend of insights from history, psychology, and economics to illuminate where today&#39;s destructive conventional wisdom came from and how it holds our country back. He also introduces us to a new way of thinking&#8212;what he calls ""tomorrow&#39;s destined ideas""&#8212;that can reinvigorate our economy, our politics, and our day-to-day lives. These destined ideas may seem counterintuitive now, but they will coalesce in the coming years in ways that will transform America. A strikingly original assessment of our current dilemma and an indispensable guide to our future, Miller&#39;s provocative and path-breaking book reveals why it is urgent that we break the tyranny of dead ideas, for it is only by doing so that we can move beyond the limits of today&#39;s obsolete debates and reinvent American capitalism and democracy for the twenty-first century.</p>";False;340;http://blip.tv/file/1659963;3;41099;http://blip.tv/file/get/SEEPROGRESS-TheTyrranyOfDeadIdeasMattMillerHIGHLIGHTS844.flv;21376658;445

381;US Iraq Policy Needs a Strategic Reset - Dr Lawerence Korb On Reclaiming US Security in the Middle E;"<p>With the Iraq war well into its fifth year, the Bush administration still lacks a realistic plan for the Middle East and Iraq. The United States must reclaim control of its core national security interests by taking active steps to stabilize the entire Middle East and abandon the delusions at the heart of President BushÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#132;¢s policies. Otherwise, U.S. security will continue to suffer by weakening the U.S. military and draining resources away from destroying terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda.</p><p>The current Iraq strategy is exactly what Al Qaeda wantsÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#128;&#157;the United States distracted and pinned down by IraqÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#132;¢s internal conflicts and trapped in a quagmire that has become the perfect rallying cry and recruitment tool for Al Qaeda. The United States has no good options given the strategic and tactical mistakes made on Iraq since 2002, but simply staying the course with an indefinite military presence is not advancing U.S. interests.</p><p>Instead, the United States must reset its strategy by looking beyond the deteriorating situation in Iraq in order to counter the threat from global terrorist groups and ensure stability in the entire Middle East and Gulf region. To do this, we need to develop a new overall Middle East strategy, not just a series of tactics focused heavily on Iraq.</p><p><a href=""http://www.americanprogress.org/"">www.americanprogress.org</a></p><p> </p>";False;141;http://blip.tv/file/299003;3;41099;http://blip.tv/file/get/SEEPROGRESS-USIraqPolicyNeedsAStrategicResetDrLawerenceKorbOnRec361.flv;8494917;448

566;V Festival steals the sunshine;"Wondering where the sunshine went this summer? Why, it went to the UK V Festival of course! Sir Richard Branson had a tactful word (he knows all the important people) and fixed it for Chelmsford that the sun should shine merrily all weekend long upon the puntership and the famous rock&apos;n&apos;roll people alike. Here in this small but perfectly formed televisual delight is proof positive that the people of Essex did behold the sun and rejoice. And while your humble host was busy schmoooozing backstage at the V Festival with celeby types such as The Futureheads and The Guillemots, what better subject did I have to talk about than the weather!?";False;55;http://blip.tv/file/1224517;3;182708;http://blip.tv/file/get/VirginBob-VFestivalStealsTheSunshine834.flv;3374868;323
